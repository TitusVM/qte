# The Qt-E Project

## A quicktime event and aiming challenge game

Qt-E is a game to challenge your general aiming and coordination capabilities with mouse and keyboard. It offers various challenging and sometimes quite demanding levels, one harder than the next.

If you are up to the challenge, hop on and look at the user documentation [here](https://gitlab-etu.ing.he-arc.ch/isc/2021-22/niveau-2/2282-1-projet-p2-il-sp/g3/-/wikis/Documentation-Utilisateur). If you know what you are doing, you can even help make the game better by following the developer documentation [here](https://gitlab-etu.ing.he-arc.ch/isc/2021-22/niveau-2/2282-1-projet-p2-il-sp/g3/-/wikis/Documentation-D%C3%A9veloppeurs). 

Enjoy!

The developers
